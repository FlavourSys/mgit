mgit let's you track all your git repositories at once. It is inspired by [App::GitGot](https://github.com/genehack/app-gitgot).

## Getting started

Install mgit:

```sh
gem install mgit
```

Add some repositories:

```sh
mgit add <path to some git repository>
```

See its status:

```sh
mgit status
```
